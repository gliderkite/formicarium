# formicarium

A basic ant colony simulation that aims to show how the collective behavior of
decentralized and self-organized artificial systems 
([swarm intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence)), allows
multiple organism to perform *better* when working together to achieve the same
goal compared with a single organism, given the same set of skills and the same
environment.

`formicarium` is built on Rust in top of the graphic engine
[ggez](https://github.com/ggez/ggez) and the entity engine
[semeion](https://github.com/gliderkite/semeion).


For a complete overview of this project, please have a look at the
[formicarium blog post](https://gliderkite.github.io/posts/formicarium).
